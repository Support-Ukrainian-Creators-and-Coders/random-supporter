# random-supporter

A simple [website](https://support-ukrainian-creators-and-coders.github.io/random-supporter/) that interacts with [these Google Spreadsheets](https://github.com/Support-Ukrainian-Creators-and-Coders/ukrainian-creators-and-coders), sending donors on a different developer's page/github with each click. Aims to make supporting ukrainian devs engaging, random and easy.
